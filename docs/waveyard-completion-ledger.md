# Waveyard completion ledger

Status of the master directive, area by area, with the evidence behind each
claim. This is deliberately split three ways — **engine**, **intelligence**,
**proof** — because most of the remaining risk is in the last two and it is
easy to mistake a passing test for a musical result.

**Nothing here is a quality claim.** Listener count is **N=0** everywhere. A
render that passes every assertion is still unjudged.

Verification environment: PostgreSQL 16.2 obtained inside the sandbox (see
`docs/waveyard-route-acceptance-environment.md`), so the route acceptance test
now *executes* rather than skipping.

## 1. Evidence inventory

| Suite | Result | What it actually proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mashup.test.ts` | 41/41 | planner behaviour, segments, stretch/pitch decisions |
| `mashup-mix-bus.test.ts` | 13/13 | balance, limiter, gating, tempo-map-faithful donor layering, replacement |
| `donor-stem-integrity.test.ts` | 18/18 | provenance refusal, PCM validation, replacement vs layering, fail-closed composition |
| `mashup-full-length.test.ts` | 4/4 | long-render measurement bounding |
| `mashup-regression.test.ts` | 6/6 | earlier planner regressions |
| `output-peak-limiter.test.ts` | 8/8 | limiter ceiling and true-peak behaviour |
| `route.test.ts` (PostgreSQL + ffmpeg) | 1/1, 0 skipped | full HTTP route, real DB, real WAV export worker |

Several assertions were **mutation-checked**: reverting the underlying fix
makes the suite fail. Those are marked below.

## 2. Area by area

### P0 — Audio integrity: **implemented, partially proven**

Engine (done): explicit composition, donor alignment to the planned entry,
`vocalsFromMs` trimming, bounded ±6 dB vocal/bed balance, the true-peak limiter
actually connected to the render path, static-gain-only-when-overshooting,
measurement cost bounded on long renders, `not-measured` reported honestly.

Correctness (done, mutation-checked): replacement fails closed unless both the
donor stem and a separable bed stem are proven; headers describe the rendered
composition, never the requested one.

Proof (partial): every number comes from synthetic fixtures with pure tones.
No real separated material has been through this path.

### P1 — Rhythmic placement: **implemented; map faithfulness now proven at unit level**

The previously unproven claim was "donor layers preserve the local tempo map".
It was not just unproven — it was **false**. `renderMashupWithBus` warped the
vocal through `segment.localTempoMap` but stretched the donor by the constant
`vocalsStretchRatio`, so a layer started together with the vocal and then slid
against it *within* the phrase. Fixed, and pinned by a test measuring click
placement at 1 s, 2 s, 5 s and 7.5 s of donor source time against the map, not
just at the entry. Mutation-checked: reverting the fix fails the test.

Still unproven: behaviour on real material with differing groove. Passage
selection quality, half-time misreads (71.8/43.4 BPM observed earlier) and the
zero-accepted-candidate ground-truth probe all remain open.

### P2 — Stem compatibility intelligence: **partially implemented, no decisions made**

Implemented: harmonic/key analysis with confidence gates, drum-transient and
bass-attack detection, vocal activity, passage fingerprints, compatibility
ranking.

Not implemented: any decision about whether a donor's drums *belong* under a
given bed. Replacement/layering is currently a user choice carried out
faithfully. Nothing verifies groove, energy or transient character. This is the
largest genuine intelligence gap and it is still untouched.

### P3 — Arrangement intelligence: **foundation only; explicitly deferred**

Form inference, phrase detection, vocal chops and continuity exist. No evidence
that entry/exit/drop decisions improved. The owner deferred this (P2 in their
numbering) until real-audio P0 acceptance; that deferral still stands.

### P4 — Candidate generation and comparison: **infrastructure done, never run on real songs**

The A/B/C/D harness exists and has already earned its keep by exposing three
defects in my own work (C identical to A, reported-but-unapplied gain, wrong
donor anchor). It has still only been run on synthetic fixtures.

### P5 — Real musical validation: **not started**

No real stems in this checkout, no renders, no matched-loudness comparison
files, no listeners. This is the binding constraint on every other claim.

### P6 — STEM.FM parity: **significant implementation, parity unproven**

Mute/solo/isolate, prepared swaps, quantised actions that refuse honestly,
session persistence and Studio handoff exist. No side-by-side acceptance
comparison against STEM.FM has been performed.

## 3. Work completed in this pass

1. **Donor layers follow the accepted local tempo map** (P1, above) — a real
   bug, not a validation gap.
2. **Export parity for donor clips.** Donor clips were saved with
   `tempoSyncEnabled: false` regardless of what the render did, so a 140 BPM
   donor over a 100 BPM bed was warped 1.4× in the render and played at its
   native rate in the export. They are now tempo-synced when the donor's tempo
   is verified, with a reported warning when it is not. Mutation-checked, and
   the stretched session is exported through the real worker.
3. **Route acceptance extended** with the tempo-parity cases and a real export
   of a stretched session.

## 4. The ordering that remains

The sequence the directive set is still correct; what has changed is that the
engine layer is now trustworthy enough to build on.

1. **Real songs, same harness.** Obtain Queen/September separated stems; run
   A/B/C/D; produce loudness-matched files; get N≥1 listeners. Until this
   happens, nothing above can be called an improvement in music.
2. **P0 acceptance on that material** — specifically the intermittent whistle,
   which is still unexplained and must be traced on real separated stems, not
   notched away.
3. **P2 intelligence** — turn existing analysis into an explained
   retain/replace/layer/reject decision for drums and bass, with measured
   compatibility separate from any score.
4. **P3 arrangement** — only after the above, and only judged by listeners.

Each step should carry the same rule used here: if a claim cannot be
mutation-checked or heard, it is not finished.
